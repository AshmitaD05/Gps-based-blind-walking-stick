📖 Overview
   Visually impaired individuals face significant challenges in navigation and safety due to limitations of traditional walking aids like white canes. This GPS-based smart      walking stick provides:
    • Real-time obstacle detection
    • Water hazard detection
    • Object recognition using AI (FOMO algorithm)
    • Live GPS tracking
    • Emergency location sharing to a guardian via SMS

🚀 Features
    • Obstacle Detection → Ultrasonic sensors detect obstacles up to 100 cm and trigger a buzzer alert.
    • Water Detection → Water level sensor detects wet/slippery surfaces and alerts with specific beep patterns.
    • Object Recognition → ESP32-CAM uses FOMO AI algorithm to detect and classify objects.
    • GPS Tracking → NEO-6M GPS module tracks user location in real time.
    • Emergency Communication → Sends current location to a guardian through Twilio SMS with Google Maps link.
    • Low Power Consumption → Uses ESP32-S3 for efficient performance.

🖥 System Architecture
   Main Modules:
    • ESP32-S3 – Central control, GPS & Twilio integration, sensor data processing.
    • Arduino UNO – ESP32-CAM integration for object detection.
    • Sensors – Ultrasonic & water detection modules for hazard alerts.
    • Communication – Twilio API for emergency SMS alerts.

⚙ Working Principle
  1️⃣ Obstacle Detection – Ultrasonic sensor measures distance; buzzer alerts if obstacle < 100 cm.
  2️⃣ Water Detection – Water sensor triggers different beep patterns based on water depth.
  3️⃣ Object Recognition – ESP32-CAM + FOMO detects and identifies objects with ~85–90% accuracy.
  4️⃣ Emergency Alert – Pressing the push button sends GPS coordinates to guardian’s phone.
  5️⃣ GPS + Twilio – Extracts latitude/longitude, formats Google Maps link, sends via SMS.

📦 Installation & Setup
   1️⃣ Hardware Assembly – Connect sensors, GPS, camera, buzzer, and buttons as per circuit diagram.
   2️⃣ Arduino IDE Setup:
       • Install ESP32 board package.
       • Install required libraries:
         ESP32, TinyGPS++, WiFi, HTTPClient, Twilio API
   3️⃣ Twilio Setup:
      Create a Twilio account.
      Get Account SID, Auth Token, and Phone Numbers.
   4️⃣ Upload Code – Flash ESP32 and Arduino UNO with respective code files.


📌 How to Use
   • Turn on the walking stick.
   • System starts monitoring for obstacles, water, and objects continuously.
   • Buzzer alerts trigger if an obstacle or water is detected.
   • In case of emergency:
     – Press the push button.
     – Guardian receives an SMS with the live GPS location.

📊 Results
    • Obstacle Detection → ±3 cm accuracy.
    • GPS Tracking → ±3 m in open areas, ±10 m in urban areas.
    • Object Recognition → ~85–90% accuracy using FOMO algorithm.
    • Water Detection → Response time less than 1 second.
