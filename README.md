üìñ Overview
   Visually impaired individuals face significant challenges in navigation and safety due to limitations of traditional walking aids like white canes. This GPS-based smart      walking stick provides:
    ‚Ä¢ Real-time obstacle detection
    ‚Ä¢ Water hazard detection
    ‚Ä¢ Object recognition using AI (FOMO algorithm)
    ‚Ä¢ Live GPS tracking
    ‚Ä¢ Emergency location sharing to a guardian via SMS

üöÄ Features
    ‚Ä¢ Obstacle Detection ‚Üí Ultrasonic sensors detect obstacles up to 100 cm and trigger a buzzer alert.
    ‚Ä¢ Water Detection ‚Üí Water level sensor detects wet/slippery surfaces and alerts with specific beep patterns.
    ‚Ä¢ Object Recognition ‚Üí ESP32-CAM uses FOMO AI algorithm to detect and classify objects.
    ‚Ä¢ GPS Tracking ‚Üí NEO-6M GPS module tracks user location in real time.
    ‚Ä¢ Emergency Communication ‚Üí Sends current location to a guardian through Twilio SMS with Google Maps link.
    ‚Ä¢ Low Power Consumption ‚Üí Uses ESP32-S3 for efficient performance.

‚öô Working Principle
  1Ô∏è‚É£ Obstacle Detection ‚Äì Ultrasonic sensor measures distance; buzzer alerts if obstacle < 100 cm.
  2Ô∏è‚É£ Water Detection ‚Äì Water sensor triggers different beep patterns based on water depth.
  3Ô∏è‚É£ Object Recognition ‚Äì ESP32-CAM + FOMO detects and identifies objects with ~85‚Äì90% accuracy.
  4Ô∏è‚É£ Emergency Alert ‚Äì Pressing the push button sends GPS coordinates to guardian‚Äôs phone.
  5Ô∏è‚É£ GPS + Twilio ‚Äì Extracts latitude/longitude, formats Google Maps link, sends via SMS.

üì¶ Installation & Setup
   1Ô∏è‚É£ Hardware Assembly ‚Äì Connect sensors, GPS, camera, buzzer, and buttons as per circuit diagram.
   2Ô∏è‚É£ Arduino IDE Setup:
‚ÄÉ‚ÄÉ     ‚Ä¢ Install ESP32 board package.
‚ÄÉ‚ÄÉ     ‚Ä¢ Install required libraries:
‚ÄÉ‚ÄÉ       ESP32, TinyGPS++, WiFi, HTTPClient, Twilio API
   3Ô∏è‚É£ Twilio Setup:
      Create a Twilio account.
      Get Account SID, Auth Token, and Phone Numbers.
   4Ô∏è‚É£ Upload Code ‚Äì Flash ESP32 and Arduino UNO with respective code files.


üìå How to Use
   ‚Ä¢ Turn on the walking stick.
   ‚Ä¢ System starts monitoring for obstacles, water, and objects continuously.
   ‚Ä¢ Buzzer alerts trigger if an obstacle or water is detected.
   ‚Ä¢ In case of emergency:
‚ÄÉ‚ÄÉ   ‚Äì Press the push button.
‚ÄÉ‚ÄÉ   ‚Äì Guardian receives an SMS with the live GPS location.

üìä Results
    ‚Ä¢ Obstacle Detection ‚Üí ¬±3 cm accuracy.
    ‚Ä¢ GPS Tracking ‚Üí ¬±3 m in open areas, ¬±10 m in urban areas.
    ‚Ä¢ Object Recognition ‚Üí ~85‚Äì90% accuracy using FOMO algorithm.
    ‚Ä¢ Water Detection ‚Üí Response time less than 1 second.
